Hi my name is Semantha.

Now that many people are getting vaccinated in India, the goverment is bringing down some restrictions on travelling.

People are very happy with this decision and so are my friends.
They want to go on the much awaited trip with me to visit popular cities in India.

But there are still some rules set by the government that we need to follow in order to travel during these times.

Help me and my friends to visit as many destinations as you can
